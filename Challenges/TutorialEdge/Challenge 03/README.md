[Challenge 03 - Sorting Flights by Price](https://tutorialedge.net/challenges/go/interfaces/)

In this challenge, you are going to be attempting to sort a list of Flights based on their price from highest to lowest.

You will have to implement the SortByPrice function that takes in a slice of type Flight and returns the sorted list of Flights.

In order to help you see what is going on, you have been provided a very quick printFlights function which you can use to print the flights out.
