[Challenge 07 - Minimums, Maximums and Errors](https://tutorialedge.net/challenges/go/min-max-errors/)

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, we`ll be testing your ability to handle edge cases and work with the errors package.

In this challenge, you have the task of implementing the GetMinMax function which will take in a slice of type Flight.

The function will return 3 values:

min - The cheapest price from the list passed in.
max - The most expensive price from the list passed in.
error - Any error values should there be issues with the list passed in.
> Hint
You can create new errors using the error package and calling errors.New().
