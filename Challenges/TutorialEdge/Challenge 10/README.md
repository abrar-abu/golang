[Challenge 10 - Word Frequencies](https://tutorialedge.net/challenges/go/word-frequencies/)

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, you will be tasked with efficiently counting the word frequencies of a large body of text in Go!

You will have to implement a function which keeps track of the number of times a word appears in a body of text and then you will have to implement a further function which returns the top 5 most frequent words from highest to lowest.

## Question
We can rely on the ordering of maps to store a list of the top 5 words, true or false?

```bash
A
True
```

```bash
B
False
```
> Correct Answer: False, you will have to rely on another data structure in order to return a list of the top 5 sorted words
