[Challenge 11 - Sets and Subsets](https://tutorialedge.net/challenges/go/sets-and-subsets/)

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, you are tasked with trying to implement a function that checks to see if a set is a sub-set of another set.

We`ll be carrying on the flying theme where the function takes in a slice of Flights and then checks to see if they exist within another slice of flights.

> Hint
There are a number of ways to solve this. You may be able to use the reflect package or you may be able to serialize each flight and create a hash of them which you can store in a hash.
