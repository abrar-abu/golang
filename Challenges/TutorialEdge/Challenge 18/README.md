[Challenge 18 - Min Rotations](https://tutorialedge.net/challenges/go/min-rotations/)

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this challenge, you will be tasked with finding out how many rotations an ordered int slice has undergone and shifted by.

# Examples:
```bash
arr := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
MinRotations(arr) // returns 2

arr := []int{3, 4, 5, 1, 2}
MinRotations(arr) // returns 3

```
