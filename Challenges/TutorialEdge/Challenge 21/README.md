[Challenge 21 - JSON and Stock Dividends](https://tutorialedge.net/challenges/go/working-with-json/)

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome Gophers! In this Go challenge, you are going to be working with JSON data and implementing a function that takes in a JSON string full of stock quotes and returns the one with the highest dividend return.

You will need to implement the HighestDividend function so that it takes in a JSON string. You will then need to somehow convert this JSON string into something you can traverse in Go using the encoding/json package.

Finally, you will need to return the string ticker for the stock that has the highest dividend.

# Example
```bash
[
  {"ticker": "APPL", "dividend": 0.5},
  {"ticker": "MSFT", "dividend": 0.2}
]

## HighestDividend returns "APPL"
```
